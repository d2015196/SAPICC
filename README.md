# SAPICC

Summer of 2017 I interned at SAP Walldorf, Germany and worked in the Integration and Certification Center. I developed a demonstration tool that SAP showed to potential clients. This consisted of an Amazon Alexa skill that serviced the SAP HANA Cloud. 

I cannot share the project but here is a snippet from the readme. 

This Amazon Alexa skill allows for smooth and easy look-ups of SAP certifications. After building this skill, one will be able to ask the following questions:

How many certifications are there in Poland?
Certifications in Germany of X  

And:

What is the company with the largest number of certifications?
What is the least recent certification? 

This is not only a very user-friendly and flexible way of providing answers to any queries about the SAP product certifications around the world, but it also shows what can be done with this relatively new device, Amazon Alexa, and the SAP Cloud serving as a back service.
